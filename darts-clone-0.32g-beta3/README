Darts-clone: A clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System)

This project provides a clone of Darts (Double-ARray Trie System), which
is a C++ header library for double-array.

The major advantages of this clone are as follows:

1. Compact dictionary

   Darts-clone uses half-size elements. This simply halves the size of
   dictionaries.

2. More compact dictionary

   Darts-clone uses directed acyclic word graphs (DAWG) instead of tries.
   Since a DAWG is derived from a trie by merging its common subtrees,
   if there are many keys which have the same value, Darts-clone requires
   less elements than Darts.

Darts-clone thus makes dictionaries more compact. And surprisingly, the
compaction does not increase the search time.
