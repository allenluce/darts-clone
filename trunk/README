Darts-clone: A clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System)

This project provides a clone of the Darts (Double-ARray Trie System),
which is a C++ header library for a double-array structure.

The major advantages of the Darts-clone are as follows:

1. Compact dictionary

   The Darts-clone uses half-size units. This simply halves the size of
   dictionaries.

2. More compact dictionary

   The Darts-clone uses a directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), which is
   derived from a trie by merging its common subtrees. On the other hand,
   the Darts uses a trie.
   Therefore, if there are many duplicate values, the Darts-clone needs
   less units than the Darts.

The Darts-clone thus makes dictionaries more compact. And surprisingly,
the compaction does not degrade the search performance.
